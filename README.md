cascadia_schedule_android_app
=============================
An experiment with Cascadia Community College class schedule web site.

For now, the app will simply output class scedule for the Summer quarter 2013.
Later, filtering capabilities will be added, as well as functionality to superimpose UWB class categories
(VLPA, I&S, etc.) to make it easier to determine which classes one needs to take to satisfy UWB prerequisites.
Feel free to make suggestions for other features.
